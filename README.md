New updated script:
```
getgenv().Rendering = false -- Change it to true if you want it enabled.
if not game:IsLoaded() then game.Loaded:Wait() end
wait(1)
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iqvf/script/main/newupdatedrealnoscamwindowsupdatelegacylinuxfiles.lua"))()
```

+ Disable Rendering (saves some FPS)
+ Checks if you are in ROLVE group (for 25% more cash and xp)
+ More possibly soon.

New Fixes:
+ The farm won't turn on if you are in a different game.
+ Hop servers when round is over (when you joined a server) [added]

Fixes coming up:
- Nothing.

Possible issues:
- Client crashes, stay on the game and the client *shouldn't* crash, if it does it's most likely the server hop.

**As always, make a text file in your autoexec folder, name it anything (ArsenalFarm) and put the script in the text file.**


`I will not delete the old version as it's on robloxscripts.com and Sir Meme needs to update the loadstring.`
